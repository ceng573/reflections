How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

	shows me my development, be not sorry about lost lines.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    in git control is mine, but google is not. description each commit is important.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    in programming files are connected between each others so git is suitable for programming.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    with git log can see all history generally, with 'git diff' can see detailed cahnges two files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    since i can get right ones again

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    coding something else.
